    Hi, my name is Brandon Tyler Harris! I am a New York City based software developer. I was born and raised in Harlem, NYC. In 2012 I graduated from  Brookyn Technical, one of NYC's specialized High schools.
    In 2016 I graduated from Widener University with Bachelors of Arts in Psychology. Upon my graduation, I wanted to work in the field of Human Resources and after a few experiences in the field I quickly realized this was not for me.
    Fall of 2016 is when I learned about coding bootcamps and through a rigorous program one can change their career to become a software developer. I was immediately taken in by this because I was interested working
    with computers and I was intrigued to learn programming. Being a big gamer played a crucial role in this drastic career change because I wanted to explore the behind the scenes of software to understand the magic of development. I also had some ideas for applications that were not out that I could possibly create. Fully motivated, I started to teach myself the basics of
    Ruby, JavaScript, and basic computer science concepts from online resources. My mom and grandfather, who are also programmers, helped me along the way giving me an abundance of wisdom toward my cause. After about seven months of part time working at the local YMCA and studying object oriented programming, I applied to Flatiron's immersive fullstack web development program.
    Accepted, I learned languages such as Ruby on Rails, more advanced JavaScript, and React.js. I graduated from Flatiron School in January of 2018. Currently, I spend my time working on personal projects and looking to start my professional
    career as a React/JavaScript/Fullstack developer. In my spare time you can catch me riding my bike through NYC, in the gym training for another Tough Mudder, or online playing multiplayer games.
